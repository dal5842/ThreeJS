# Notes:

To push changes to the repo only, do a normal add-commit-push.

To push changes to your GitHub pages, run

```
npm run deploy
```

This pushes what's in your "dist" directory to your gh-pages branch (which appears on your GitHub pages). So, remember as you're working in your local environment with npm run dev, copy those files into the dist directory when you're complete to put them on your GitHub pages.
